## Farcaster Frames V2 Demo

Farcaster Frames V2 Demo is the ultimate educational tool to start the exploration of farcaster frames v2. With links to the docs, tutorials, guides, examples and reusable components. Mastering this repo will bring your frame skills to the next level. Are you ready to build the future, anon?

#### Disclaimer
While you can access the website with no problem and get access to the static content, we encourage everyone to open it in the warpcast app or any other farcaster client for a better performance and get access to all features.

This application includes code from other educational resources like links to the docs, all the links from the v2frames website, the og frames demo by deodad and horsefacts, and adapted versions of the swap token and yoink components by horsefacts.
The idea is to showcase how easy is to stack educational content and components from several sources and encourage the collaboration for building a better educational tool.

### Explore, Learn, Reuse, Contribute

All components and sections are designed to help builders in the process of learning and building frames. Including the most essential and basic features like reading and writing onchain transactions or notifications. They all are reusable and we encourage everyone to build and contribute with their own components and help growing this educational application.

Every component include a github link to access the code of the component easily. Every component is loading the farcaster sdk and context and calling the `sdk.actions.ready` function, allowing easy reusability, just copy pasting the component.

The examples, the quiz, the tutorials and guides are all designed to grow with your collaboration and help us creating the ultimate learning reosurce for building frames.
